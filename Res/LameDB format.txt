Lamedb format
File format of lamedb explained.
 Taken from /lib/dvb/db.cpp and Tools/Transponder.py.
 File is basically a fixed format file where some fields contain multiple values separated by commas of colons. Lines may not exceed 256 characters.
 It contains two sections.

•Transponders started by a line transponders. Contains transponder frequencies, symbol rates, polarization and satellite position.
•Services started by a line services. Contains SSID, Card ID for channels on a particular transponder.

Header Line
The file starts with a line eDVB services /%d/, where %d is format version.

eDVB services /4/

Transponders section
Section starts with a line transponders.
 Followed by a DVB line and transponder data line tuples. The DVB data line starts at col 0, the transponder data line immediatly follows and starts with a <TAB>.
 Lines starting at col0 contains three fields encoded in hexadecimal:
•DVB namespace
•Transport stream id
•Original network id

 Lines starting with a <TAB> character and contain DVB transponder data such as frequency and symbol rate. Three types of DVB transponders can be encoded here:

•Satellite DVB
•Terestrial DVB
•Cable DVB

Satellite lines start with <TAB>s like:  s 10773250:22000000:0:2:192:2:0:1:2:0:2 fields for version 3 and 4. All fields are separated by colons, values in decimal.


•Frequency in Hertz.
•Symbol rate in bits per second.
•Polarization: 0=Horizontal, 1=Vertical, 2=Circular Left, 3=Circular right.
•Forward Error Control (FEC): 0=None , 1=Auto, 2=1/2, 3=2/3, 4=3/4 5=5/6, 6=7/8, 7=3/5, 8=4/5, 9=8/9, 10=9/10.
•Orbital Position: in degrees East: 130 is 13.0E, 192 is 19.2E. Negative values are West -123 is 12.3West. 
•Inversion: 0=Auto, 1=On, 2=Off
•Flags (Only in version 4): Field is absent in version 3.
•System: 0=DVB-S 1=DVB-S2.
•Modulation: 0=Auto, 1=QPSK, 2=QAM16, 3=8PSK.
•Rolloff (Only used in DVB-S2): 0=0.35, 1=0.25, 3=0.20
•Pilot (Only used in DVB-S2): 0=Auto, 1=Off, 1=On.


Terrestrial lines start with <TAB>t:


•frequency in Hertz.
•Bandwidth: 0=Auto, 1=8Mhz, 2=7Mhz, 3=6Mhz.
•Code rate High Pass FEC: 0=Auto, 1=1/2, 2=2/3, 3=3/4, 4=5/6, 5=7/8.
•Code rate Low Pass FEC: 0=Auto, 1=1/2, 2=2/3, 3=3/4, 4=5/6, 5=7/8.
•Modulation: 0=Auto, 1=QPSK, 2=QAM16, 3=QAM64.
•Transmission mode: 0=Auto, 1=2k, 3=8k
•Guard Interval: 0=Auto, 1=1/32, 2=1/16, 3=1/8, 4=1/4
•Hierarchy: 0=Auto, 1=None, 2=1, 3=2, 4=4
•Inversion: 0=Auto, 1=On, 2=Off.
•Flags


Cable lines start with <TAB>c:

•Frequency in Hertz.
•Symbol rate.
•Inversion: 0=Auto, 1=On, 2=Off.
•Modulation: 0=Auto, 1=QAM16, 2=QAM32, 3=QAM64, 4=QAM128, 5=QAM256.
•Forward Error Control innert (FEC_inner): 0=None, 1=Auto, 2=1/2, 3=2/3, 4=3/4, 5=5/6, 6=7/8, 7=8/9.
•Flags

services section

The section starts with the word services on a line by itself.
 Followed by a three line tuple: DVB stream data, Channel name, Provider data line.
 The DVB stream data line contains six fields:

•Service id (SSID value from stream) in Hex
•DVB namespace in Hex.
•Transport stream id in Hex
•Original network id in Hex
•Service type in Decimal: 1=TV, 2=Radio
•Service number in Decimal.


The Channel name is on a line by itself in some character encoding (to be investigated)
 The last line contains Provider Service data. Variable number of fields, separated by commas. Fields formed like <tag>:value. For example p:Sky Digital,c:000202,c:010282,c:020242,c:030202,c:0500 01,C:0963,C:0961,C:0960.

•Provider name field. Field tag p: Name of provider.
•Cached data. Field tag c: followed by two decimal digits and four hexadecimal digits. For example c:010282 is composed of 01 decimal cache id, 0282 hexadecimal value to cache.
•Card ID (CIAD). Field tag C: follwed by four hexadecimal digits: Card ID. For example C:0100.
•Flag data: Field tag f: followed by hexadecimal digits.
